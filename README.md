# smoke-renderer
A university project to write a renderer for some volumetric data for smoke.
The main point are the two rendering methods (splatting in the smokeParticle shaders and texture slicing in the smokeSlice shaders) as well as the implementation of deep shadow maps to get nice shadows on objects within the smoke cloud.
The Framework (basic window with an OpenGL rendering viewport) was cloned from a homework project setup from Fraunhofer IGD.
